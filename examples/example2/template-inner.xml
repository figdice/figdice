<!-- We are including here a "sub-template". Keep in mind that, from the View
		 object's point of view, this is a sub-template, but the DOM elements that
		 the sub-template produce will end up being _parent_ objects for our tags
		 above.
		 This is no contradiction in FigDice: thanks to the Plug/Slot mechanism
		 the templates do not need to be loaded/writted in a linear way. -->
