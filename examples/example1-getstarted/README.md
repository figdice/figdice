**FigDice Example 1**

In this example we will learn to:

  - get started with the library
  - load a template by its outer container file (This is not the recommended FigDice way!)
  - direct push some data into the template (your compatibility mode with other classic engines, but this is not yet the FigDice recommended way. See example 4 - Feeds)
  - pass objects to templates
  - control the textual content of tags
  - inline dynamic data into HTML attributes
  - embed unparsed content
