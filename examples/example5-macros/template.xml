<!-- Let's define our macro in a separate file. -->
<fig:include file="macro-definitions.xml" />

<!-- Iterate over our data -->
<div class="country-container" fig:walk="/countries">
	<!-- And let's invoke our macro here, inside the loop!
	     
	     Macro arguments can be passed in two ways:
	     - direct inline attributes,
	     - or <fig:param> immediate child
	     
	     We will use here the inline attributes. Every attribute of
	     our span tag (holding the fig:call attribute) is considered
	     as an argument to the macro call.
	     See in the macro definition how we use the "countryName" and
	     "item" parameters as usual elements of the (local) universe within
	     the macro execution.
	     
	     NB: the "class" argument below is also a macro argument!
       CAUTION: a macro-invokation tag (i.e. a tag with a fig:call
       attribute) is always mute. Therefore, you will not find the
       following tag with class="dummy-macro-call" in the output.
       The tag is solely used as a container for the arguments.
       NB: in a macro call, the arguments are Expressions, which
       are evaluated just before the call, and whose results are passed
       to the macro. Therefore, if you need to pass a string, do not forget
       to pass it as a string litteral (with single quotes)!

    countryName="key()"
    item="."
    my-string-litteral=" 'some string here' "
