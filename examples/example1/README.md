**FigDice Example 1**

In this example we will learn to:

  - get started with the library
  - load a template by its outer container file (This is not the recommended FigDice way!)
  - push some data into the template (Simple: this, too, is done better in the next examples)
  - control the textual content of tags
  - inline dynamic data into HTML attributes
  - embed unparsed content
